# Predictive Analytics — Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses Python and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for customer churn.

The objective is to:
- Understand customer behavior
- Identify key churn drivers
- Build and evaluate predictive models

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Methods Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation

## 🚀 Results
The final model achieved strong predictive performance and helped identify important churn factors such as usage patterns and customer tenure.
